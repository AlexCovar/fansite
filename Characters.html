		<a id="top"><h1> Super Smash Brothers Characters</h1></a>

		<p><strong> One of the reasons people love this game so much is because of the wide variety of characters. Nintendo has incorperated characters from most of their major franchises. In no other game can you find Mario and Link beating eachother up With the 4th entry in the game there are now 58, Theres no way that i could show all of the characters so i decided to put the different type of fighters. There are characters that are average at everything, gunners, sword fighters, speed characters, heavy characters, and tech characters. Each character might have more than one of these like Mega-Man who is a speed gunner vs Samus who is a Power-Gunner. </strong></p>

			<a id="mario"> <p>Mario is the all around character, Mario's stats are average in almost everthing. He doesnt really have any strengths or weaknesses. Mario has manu tools to use with him like his fireballs or F.L.O.O.D (which can be used to push opponents off the edge) Mario is a good starter character being that there are no real disavantages to choosing him.   </p> </a>

			<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ssb/images/7/75/Link_Splash.png/revision/latest?cb=20140908084344" width="200" class="imgLeft">
			<a id="link"> <p> Link is a complete power character, Link uses his bow and arror, bombs, hookshot, and the master sword to launch his opponents all around the map. Link sacrifices his speed with a lot of his heavy attacks taking a second longer to launch, but once you figure out his weight and how to move around easily with it link is almost unstoppable. Link isnt for players who arent skilled at moving around the map.</p> </a>

			 <a id="pikachu"> <p>Pikachu is one of the fastest characters in the game. Pikachu can zip around the map and use lightning to his advantage, but the downside is that pikachu sacrifices power for his speed. Pikachu can hit you quickly, but he cant hit you hard. If you play pikachu you need to get your opponent in a lot of combos to make up for the loss of damage. Pikachu is for players who understand the controls and can use them without thinking about it.</p> </a>

			<img src="https://images3.alphacoders.com/556/556799.png" width="200" class="imgLeft">
			<a id="megaman"><p> Megaman is a gunner character, Megaman uses his hand gun, saws, leaves, electricity, fire, and robo dog to try and knock his opponent out. Megaman has a lot of power and speed, he can run around the map quickly and hit hard, but only from a distance. While megamax is great at long range combat, if an opponent gets too close to you there not much you can do. Megaman lacks a lot of close range combat which can be hard to get over if you fight someone like Link.  </p></a>

		<a id="pacman">	<p> Pacman is a tech character. He uses his ghosts, fire hydrant, and his retro arcade objects to knock down his opponents. Pacman relys more on his items than pure power, This helps keep a distance from your opponent and lets you do a ot of damage, but the downside is that a lot of these objects take a while to get out. To get the strongest retro item you need to wait like 10 seconds for pacman to charge up. Pacman is for people who can get the timing of his attacks. </p></a>

			<a id="kirby"><p> Kirby is probably the most unique character in the game. Kirby has the ability to swallow his opponents adn steal their abilities. So if he swallows mario, he gets the mario hat and can shoot fire balls, with link he gets his bow and arrow and hat and so on. This means kirby can have a wide variety of different play styles. The original kirby is a speed character, he can move around the map quickly and float around the map.  </p></a> 

			<img src="https://images5.alphacoders.com/515/515260.png" width="200" class="imgLeft">
			 <a id="dk"><p>Donkey Kong is a complete power house. Donkey Kong sacrifices a ton of speed for his hard hits and defense. Donkey kong can be up to 120% damage and still not be flying around the map. His moves hit hard and he can take a lot of hits. His speed is something that you would have to get used to, being one of the slowest and heaviest in the game. Donkey Kon is for players who love to show their power and dont mind the loss of speed. </p>
</a>

			<img src="https://images2.alphacoders.com/556/556792.png" width="200" class="imgLeft">
			<a id="tl"> <p>Toon link is a very quick character, his small size allows him to move around quickly and deal really heavy attacks. Toon Link may be small but he has a lot of power in his hits, almost as much as regular link. But what he gains in speed and damage he loses in defense, a few hits will send toon link flying across the map making it hard to stay alive. Toon link is for someone who knows how to avoid attacks and use the map to their advantage. </p></a>

			<img src="http://www.meleeitonme.com/wp-content/uploads/Little-Mac-660x350.png" width="200" class="imgLeft">
			<a id="Lilmac"> <p> Little Mac is a ground fighter, he is at his best with both his feet on the ground, he can hit his opponents crazy hard and hes even one of the strongest characters in the game. His defense isnt that good but its better than someone like toon link. Where little mac stuggles is in the air, in the air his attacks do less damage and dont pack as much heat, but a lot of your fights are going to be in the air. You have to learn how to adapt to play Little Mac</p></a>
